        <div id="interests">Here is what I'm about

            <h3 class="sub_heading">
                I'm a second year computer engineering student at the University of Guelph 
                who loves everything about computers -software and hardware- and I'm looking
                working towards a career in the field.
            </h3>

            <h3 class="sub_heading">Things I can do</h3>
            <p class="para">
                I’m proficient in the programming languages of C and Java, specifically 
                with regards to data parsing, implementing basic data structures, and 
                creating basic GUIs.
            </p>

            <h3 class="sub_heading">Things I'm learning about</h3>
            <p class="para">
                I’m still learning about the ins and outs of web development; this site 
                is actually my first and totally written from scratch. I hope to eventually
                be competent enough to be able to work as a web developer potentially.
            </p>
            <p class="para">
                While we wait for that enjoy this javascript applet to the right looks like
                a console.
            </p>
            <p class="para">
                I also mentioned hardware, it is really my true passion and I’m learning 
                to exercise this passion through basic hardware design through VHDL and
                FPGA boards (helped design and build a working mips CPU). I also have a
                lot to learn here but I’m having a lot of fun with it.
            </p>

            <h3 class="sub_heading">Things I want to learn how to do</h3>
            <p class="para">
                I want to learn at least basic syntax and functionality of many more 
                languages to expand my horizons. I’m currently dipping my toes into the 
                world of python and have yet to look into SQL and related data base tools. 
                I’m working towards at least learning at least the basics over the rest of the year.
